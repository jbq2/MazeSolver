# MazeSolver
Recursive maze solver that traces valid/invalid paths in a text file.
First Line in the text file displays the dimensions of the baze.
The following lines are the actual maze:
  - X's are the walls
  - + (in the unsolved maze) is the starting position
  - - is the destination
  - + (in the solved maze) is the correct path
  - . (in the solved maze) are deadend paths
